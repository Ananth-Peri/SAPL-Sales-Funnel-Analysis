Strent AH Pvt Limited (SAPL) is a student hostel chain in India that experienced a low conversion rate of leads during the admissions season.
The objective is to analyze the sales funnel, identify sub-stages, and provide insights and recommendations to increase the conversion rate.
The analysis involved merging tables using Excel and Python, creating funnel charts to identify bottlenecks, and using Tableau for visualizations.
The comparison of visited and agreed-upon students in major cities showed significant differences that need further scrutiny.
The project helped improve understanding of funnel analysis, proficiency in Excel, Python, and Tableau, and problem statement comprehension.
